# Conan Linux Script

### ⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED, FEEL FREE TO USE IT AS A RESOURCE TO MAKE YOUR OWN ⚠️

## Description

Script made in order to make administration of a Conan Exiles server on Linux easy

Features are described in the Usage section.

Feel free to send your fixs/distro compatibilities/features by sending a pull request. 

| Distributions	| Versions		  | Status    |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| Ubuntu      	| 16.04 *server*  | Supported |
| Ubuntu      	| 16.04 *desktop* | Supported |


## Usage

 * **start** : Start the server. Don't do anything if a server is running.

 * **stop** : Shutdown the server cleanly by sending a SIGINT to the screen.

 * **reboot [reason]** : Restart the server securely. You can specify a message to send with your Discord Bot.     
   *(i.e.: conan reboot "Quick reboot to flush memory leaks !")*

 * **update** : Check for available updates. If needed, close the server, apply the update and restart.

 * **show** : Display running server(s).

 * **screen** : Display the server console to look at your server logs. Use "**Ctrl + A**" then "**Ctrl + D**" to leave the screen without stopping the server.

 * **install** : Install the whole server and dependencies
    + Creates a specific user for running your server
    + Set up a minimal iptables configuration
    + Install wine 2.0, screen, steamCmd...
    + Download server files

 * **discord** : Install a Discord Bot that will handle handle communication between the script and your Discord server.      
 Currently available announces:
 	+ Server start
 	+ Server stop
 	+ Delayed announce before server shutdown
 	+ Server updates
 	+ Server custom reboots
	+ RaidsHours ON/OFF

  *Admins may be able in the future to handle the server with commands on a specific channel*

 * **raidhours** : Enable a daily period where raids are possible. You need to configure the script and run "conan crontab".      
  *This will require a reboot of your server to apply the changements. Your players will be warned with a Discord message and a delay*

 * **crontab** : Enable crontabs to automate the management of your server.
 	+ auto-restarter: Restart your server if it crashs when you're not here to restart it.
 	+ auto-updater: Let the script handle updates for you.
 	+ raid hours: Automate the "raidhours" task.

# How-to-use

## Downloading & Configuration

Clone the repository containing the scripts, then change your current directory to where you have cloned the repository

	git clone https://github.com/Slympp/ConanLinuxScript && cd ConanLinuxScript

Open your favorite text editor to set up your parameters: ServerName, ports, paths, raids hours, the discord Bot...

	nano conan


## Server installation, need root privileges

Run the script. You will be asked to create a new user (or use an already existing one). For this guide, user will be "steam"

	sudo bash conan install


(Optional) Install the Discord bot. It will announce the shutdowns/updates/reboots

	sudo bash conan discord


Give permissions to your $user

	sudo chown steam:steam conan discord_bot.py


Move both bash and python script in the $user home

	cp conan discord_bot.py /home/steam/


Create a symbolic link to make your life easier (and crontabs working)

	sudo ln -s /home/steam/conan /usr/bin/conan


Installation is almost finished, you should now always use your user to interact with the script and your server.
If you're using a desktop version or ssh, disconnect from your session and login as $user (it's recommended in order to avoid errors with screen)


## Using the server, as $user

**You should always use your Conan Exiles specific user to interact with your server.**

(Recommended) Set up your crontabs

	./conan crontab   

*Logs will be available in /home/$user/logs*


Start your server

	./conan start


Check that your server is running.

	./conan show


Look at the logs by attaching the screen. Detach with **Ctrl + A** then **Ctrl + D**

	./conan screen

Enjoy ! :D



## TODO :

* Send in game messages when RCON will be supported
